# üîê Password Complexity & Security Analysis

This project explores how password complexity affects security. It includes the creation of multiple passwords with varying complexity, testing them using online password strength checkers, and summarizing best practices and common attacks on passwords.

---

## üìã Project Objectives

1. Generate passwords with different combinations of:
   - Uppercase letters
   - Lowercase letters
   - Numbers
   - Symbols
   - Lengths
2. Evaluate each password using password strength checkers.
3. Record and analyze the results.
4. Identify best practices for creating strong passwords.
5. Research and summarize common password attacks (e.g., brute force, dictionary).
6. Reflect on how password complexity enhances security.

## üîë Password Samples and Evaluation

| Password              | Strength Score | Time to Crack     | Feedback                      |
|-----------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| `Password123`         | Fair           | A few minutes     | Add symbols for improvement   |
| `P@ssw0rd!`           | Good           | Hours‚ÄìDays        | Slightly predictable          |
| `X8!j$e2R#pL`         | Strong         | 100+ years        | Random and secure             |
| `T!m3T0Ch@ng3!Tn0w2025` | Very Strong   | 1000+ years       | Excellent complexity and length |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Use **12 characters or more**.
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters**.
- Avoid **dictionary words or personal information**.
- Use a **password manager** to generate and store passwords.
- Create **unique passwords** for each account.

## üõ°Ô∏è Common Password Attacks

### Brute Force Attack
- Attempts every possible character combination.
- Fast on short, simple passwords.

### Dictionary Attack
- Tries passwords from a list of common or leaked passwords.
- Very effective on weak or reused passwords.

## üß† Summary: Password Complexity & Security

The more complex a password is, the harder it is for attackers to crack it. Strong passwords significantly delay or prevent brute-force and dictionary attacks. A good security practice is to regularly update passwords and avoid reuse across platforms.
